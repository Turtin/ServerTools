# ServerTools
Just random stuff that might help, or just be cool for minecraft

**Planned Features**

- Chat messages being sent to discord, using discord bot and webhooks
- Crash command that crash players client (somehow if possible) (Delayed)
- /Vanish
- Configuration
- Scheduled restarts which countdowns and force restart
- Backup system
- Minecraft gui creator (Probably will happen, and may include a web tool for this as well)

Note that this plugin requires a discord bot, and one is not provided, to use it, create your own bot in the discord developer portal and ensure that is has permission to create webhooks and send messages, for simplicity just give it admin. If you don't do this, the plugin may run slower or spam a bunch of error after every message. Or just turn off the discord intergration.

There are also a bunch of issues that I can either not fix or don't know how to, such as the bot not liking when the server is reloaded or minecraft not letting you chat after doing /minecraft:w, that last one if caused by the relatively new chat reporting system.
